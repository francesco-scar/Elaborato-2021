# Elaborato 2021

This is just a school project, nothing really usefull, but it implements a gradient descent algorithm in a 4D space to find the center of the sun, in an image captured with a mouse sensor (yes, a sensor usually used in mouse applications, sounds promising, isn't it?).

In this repository you can find all the source code I used in this project and a UI demo page at [francesco-scar.github.io/Elaborato-2021/main/ESP32_main_sketch/data/index.html](https://francesco-scar.github.io/Elaborato-2021/main/ESP32_main_sketch/data/index.html?lang=en&demo=1) (click [here](https://francesco-scar.github.io/Elaborato-2021/main/ESP32_main_sketch/data/index.html?lang=it&demo=1) for an italian version of the page).

You can find the explanation of the project [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francesco-scar/Elaborato-2021/main/Elaborato-2021.pdf) (unfortunately it's in italian).
